# RepeatedNumbers
This Program can find which number( s ) repeated your array, using check index algorithm.
If number and checking number is the same algorithm check checking number's index is less or greater than number'index 
if less this means that checking number also repeated number,
otherwise program find this number and assign the value which is repeated number as well check how many times repeat this number !
That's it
